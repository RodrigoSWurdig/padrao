# ENG-1914 Development Environment Metrics

## Execution Date: [YOUR DATE]
## Environment: CubeCloud Development

## Pre-Migration Cleanup

- **Orphaned emails preserved**: [NUMBER from cleanup_metrics.txt]
- **Orphaned jobs deleted**: [NUMBER from cleanup_metrics.txt]

### Source Distribution
```
[PASTE TABLE from cleanup_metrics.txt showing data_source and orphaned_count]
```

## Junction Table Migration

- **LinkedIn URLs migrated**: [NUMBER from migration_counts.txt]
- **Facebook/5x5 IDs migrated**: [NUMBER from migration_counts.txt]
- **PDL IDs migrated**: [NUMBER from migration_counts.txt]

## Duplicate Detection

- **Iterations to convergence**: [NUMBER from convergence_log.txt]
- **Duplicate groups found**: [NUMBER from group_distribution.txt]
- **Largest group size**: [NUMBER from group_distribution.txt]

### Component Size Distribution
```
[PASTE TABLE from group_distribution.txt showing component_size and component_count]
```

## Merge Results

- **Active persons before**: [NUMBER from merge_results.txt]
- **Merged persons**: [NUMBER from merge_results.txt]
- **Active persons after**: [NUMBER from merge_results.txt]
- **Reduction percentage**: [PERCENTAGE from merge_results.txt]%

## Winner Selection Sample

### Example Group 1
```
[PASTE example showing winner selection reasoning from merge_results.txt]
Winner selected: VUP-XXX (reason: highest job count)
```

### Example Group 2
```
[PASTE example showing winner selection reasoning]
Winner selected: VUP-YYY (reason: most recent activity)
```

### Example Group 3
```
[PASTE example showing winner selection reasoning]
Winner selected: VUP-ZZZ (reason: temporal tiebreaker - oldest created_at)
```

## Validation Checks

- [ ] All junction table counts match source data
- [ ] Winner selection uses cleartext > jobs > recency > created_at ordering
- [ ] No HEM-based duplicates in detection phase
- [ ] Label propagation converged (changes_detected = 0)
- [ ] Merge preserved all email relationships
- [ ] Active person count reduced by expected percentage
