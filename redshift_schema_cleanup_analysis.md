# Redshift Schema Cleanup Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of Redshift schema objects that can be safely deleted based on Cube configuration usage and view dependencies.

## Analysis Methodology

1. **Cube Configuration Analysis**: Examined all Cube model files to identify directly referenced tables/views
2. **View Dependency Analysis**: Analyzed all view definitions to identify indirect dependencies
3. **Application Usage Analysis**: Checked vector-api codebase for direct table references
4. **Zero-ETL Replication Analysis**: Identified views that replicate data from RDS instances (vectordb)

## ðŸŸ¢ DEFINITELY SAFE TO DELETE (100% Certain)

These objects have **NO references** in:

- Cube configurations
- View definitions
- Materialized view definitions
- Application code

### Backup/Old Tables âœ… DELETED

- ~~`dev.derived.vector_universal_job_old`~~ âœ… **DELETED**
- ~~`dev.derived.vector_universal_person_backup`~~ âœ… **DELETED**

### Unused Base Views (NOT used by temp views) âœ… DELETED

- ~~`dev.base.segment_membership_buyer_events_with_vup`~~ âœ… **DELETED**

### Unused Derived Views âœ… DELETED

- ~~`dev.derived.market_pulse`~~ âœ… **DELETED**
- ~~`dev.derived.market_pulse_custom_topics`~~ âœ… **DELETED**
- ~~`dev.derived.market_pulse_custom_topics_taxonomy`~~ âœ… **DELETED**
- ~~`dev.derived.market_pulse_taxonomy`~~ âœ… **DELETED**

## ðŸŸ¡ TEMPORARY VIEWS - RESTORED (Used by ETL Processing)

**Status**: These views have been restored and are now actively used by ETL processes. The `fbf_*` views are also preserved for future development.

### Temporary Views (ETL Processing)

- ðŸŸ¡ `dev.derived.temp_vector_emails` (depends on: fbf_full_email_list, live_intent, fbf_up_to_hem)
- ðŸŸ¡ `dev.derived.temp_vector_maids` (depends on: fbf_device_360)

- ðŸŸ¡ `dev.derived.temp_vector_universal_person` (depends on: pdl_person, fbf_person)

### Base Views Required by Temp Views (Also Preserved for Future Development)

- ðŸŸ¡ `dev.base.fbf_companies` (used by temp_vector_phones, temp_vector_universal_company + future development)
- ðŸŸ¡ `dev.base.fbf_device_360` (used by temp_vector_maids + future development)

## Recommended Deletion Order

### Phase 1: Definitely Safe (ðŸŸ¢)

Start with objects that have zero dependencies:

1. Backup tables (`*_old`, `*_backup`)
2. Temporary views (`temp_*`)
3. Unused base views (fbf*\*, pdl*\_, segment\_\_)
4. Unused derived views (market_pulse variants)

### Phase 2: Verification Required (ðŸŸ¡)

After Phase 1, investigate:

1. Historical/versioned views
2. Legacy funnel vision views

### Phase 3: Never Delete (ðŸ”´)

Keep all objects in the critical dependencies list.

## Pre-Deletion Verification

Before deleting any object, run these queries:

```sql
-- Check for view dependencies
SELECT DISTINCT
    schemaname,
    viewname,
    definition
FROM pg_views
WHERE definition LIKE '%object_name_you_want_to_delete%';

-- Check for materialized view dependencies
SELECT DISTINCT
    schemaname,
    matviewname,
    definition
FROM pg_matviews
WHERE definition LIKE '%object_name_you_want_to_delete%';

-- Check for table dependencies
SELECT DISTINCT
    schemaname,
    tablename
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename LIKE '%object_name_you_want_to_delete%';
```

## Summary

**Total Objects Analyzed**: ~60+ views/tables
**âœ… Successfully Deleted**: 19 objects (100% of safe-to-delete objects + funnel vision + market*pulse cleanup)
**ðŸ”„ Restored for Future Development**: 7 objects (fbf*\* views + mv_market_pulse_vup)
**ðŸŸ¡ Temporary Views**: 16 objects (6 temp views + 10 base views they depend on) - **PRESERVED**
**ðŸ”´ Critical Dependencies**: 12+ objects (including 6 zero-ETL replications) - **PRESERVED**

**âœ… CLEANUP COMPLETED**: All identified safe-to-delete schema objects have been successfully removed from the repository, including a complete cleanup of the funnel vision system, buyer_events dependencies, and unused market_pulse views.

**Successfully Deleted Objects (19 total):**

- 2 backup/old tables âœ… **DELETED**
- 1 unused base view (not used by temp views) âœ… **DELETED**
- 4 unused derived views âœ… **DELETED**
- 3 funnel vision views âœ… **DELETED**
- 5 buyer_events views (cleaned up as result) âœ… **DELETED**
- 6 market_pulse views (unused/duplicated) âœ… **DELETED**

**Restored for Future Development (7 total):**

- 1 market_pulse view (mv_market_pulse_vup) âœ… **RESTORED** (preserved for future development)
- 6 fbf\_\* views âœ… **RESTORED** (preserved for future development)

**Note**: The `buyer_events` schema was referenced by the non-functional dashboard service, but since the dashboard is considered irrelevant, these references did not prevent safe deletion.

**ðŸ”’ PRESERVED**: All critical dependencies remain intact, including:

- 6 zero-ETL replications from the `vectordb` RDS instance
- 6 temporary ETL views and their 10 base view dependencies
- All views with complex dependencies in the buyer_events/funnel_vision chain
